===================
Development of Guru
===================

If you want to participate in the development of Guru, send me a note:
my github username at gmail.com. The best place to get started is to look at
TODO.txt and find something you think you can do.

The philosophy Guru takes is that changes to the original Sage notebook
code is kept to an absolute minimum. This philosophy has been very
easy to adhere to.

The code lives on github: https://github.com/rljacobson/Guru.
