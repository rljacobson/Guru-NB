Development of Guru
===================

If you want to participate in the development of Guru, send me a note:
my github username at gmail.com. The best place to get started is to look at
TODO.txt and find something you think you can do.

The philosophy Guru takes is that changes to the original Sage notebook
code is kept to an absolute minimum. This philosophy has been very
easy to adhere to.

The code lives on github: https://github.com/rljacobson/Guru.

The original HACKING.rst for the Sage Notebook Server follows.

Development of the Sage notebook
================================

Unlike most other parts of Sage (as of January 2013), development of
sagenb is done on a moving target, namely a git repository on GitHub.
Rather than making changes to the version of sagenb that came with your
copy of Sage, please first clone `the sagenb git repository`_ and
install it into your copy of Sage before you start coding. Details on
how to do this are as follows.

#.  Install `the latest development version of Sage`_ from sagemath.org.

#.  Sign up for an account at github.com, if you don't already have one,
    and log in; set up your SSH keys for authentication as directed by
    the instructions.

#.  Create your own fork of sagenb on the GitHub website. To do this, go
    to `the sagenb git repository`_ page and click on "Fork" in the
    upper right corner of the webpage.

#.  Clone your fork of sagenb to somewhere on your local disk, for
    example ``~/src/sagenb``::

        $ cd ~/src
        $ git clone git@github.com:<your username>/sagenb sagenb

#.  Where ``$SAGE_ROOT`` represents the base path of your Sage
    installation, perform the following commands::

        $ cd $SAGE_ROOT/devel
        $ rm sagenb
        $ ln -s ~/src/sagenb sagenb     # or wherever your clone is
        $ cd sagenb
        $ $SAGE_ROOT/sage --python setup.py develop

#.  You can also add the `sagenb`_ git repository as a remote branch
    called ``upstream``::

        $ git remote add upstream git@github.com:sagemath/sagenb
        $ git remote update upstream

    This will allow you to update your local repository as other
    people's changes are merged. Such an operation might look something
    like this::

        $ git remote update upstream    # learn what has changed
        $ git checkout master           # move to local master
        $ git merge upstream/master     # merge changes to local master

This completes the installation process. Now you can modify files in
your ``sagenb`` directory and submit your modifications to us using pull
requests on GitHub. (A full walkthrough of using git and GitHub are
beyond the scope of this file -- for more information see `the relevant
section in the Sage manual`_.)

If you ever need to switch to using another Sage installation for your
sagenb development, you only need to repeat step 5 with the new value of
``$SAGE_ROOT``.
