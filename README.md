What is Guru?
=============

Guru is a stand-alone editor for Sage worksheet files. In other words, Guru
is a Sage front end. At present, Guru requires Sage to be available locally
from the command line to function. Future versions will not require a
local Sage installation at all.

Guru is essentially a fork of the Sage Notebook.
