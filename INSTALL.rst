====================
Installation of Guru
====================

To be determined.

=================================
Installation of the Sage notebook
=================================

Currently, standalone usage of the Sage notebook is not supported,
though this is one of our goals for the future. For now, please use
sagenb with a copy of `Sage`_.

The `latest version of Sage`_ should come with a somewhat recent version
of the Sage notebook, and the `latest development version of Sage`_
a possibly more recent version.

Alternatively, see HACKING.rst for instructions on how to install the
truly latest, development version of sagenb into an already installed
copy of Sage. This is only recommended for people who want to modify the
code of sagenb, since the development version may be buggy or otherwise
unsuitable for daily use (standard disclaimer).
