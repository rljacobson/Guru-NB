EASY
====

Get rid of those stub messages.

Implement the following menu items:
	New Cell
	New Text Cell
	Typeset output

There is no consistent name for a server configuration. Is it:
	server_config
	sage_configuration
	sage_server
	server
	...??
Pick one and make the code consistent.

Filename: One word or two? Choose either filename or file_name and make the code consistent.

Other sources of variable name inconsistency:
	Nonpublic properties should be preceded by _.
	Properties with getters/setters should use the @property @name.setter idioms.
	Standard Python naming conventions should be employed. See http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions.


MEDIUM
======

There are 4 ways MainWindow communicates with the worksheet:
	1. Calling WorksheetController functions a la self.webviewcontroller.worksheetcontroller.function().
	2. Passing function references to the WebviewController's initializer, then on up to the WorksheetController.
	3. Custom slots/signals.
	4. Intermediate functions in the WebviewController.
This should be made consistent, as this is a mess.

Make app translation-ready. The Qt code uses Qt's translation framework, while the sagenb code uses babel. We
should probably standardize on babel.

Make app runnable on Windows.

HARD
====

Remove dependence on sagenb.notebook.notebook.

Remove unneeded dependencies (openssl, etc.).

UNKNOWN
=======

Implement the following worksheet properties:
	Input system
		Sage
		gap
		gp
		html
		Maxima
		etc.
