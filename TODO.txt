Something is very broken.

Get rid of those stub messages.

There are 4 ways MainWindow communicates with the worksheet:
	1. Calling WorksheetController functions a la self.webviewcontroller.worksheetcontroller.function().
	2. Passing function references to the WebviewController's initializer, then on up to the WorksheetController.
	3. Custom slots/signals.
	4. Intermediate functions in the WebviewController.
This should be made consistent, as this is a mess.
