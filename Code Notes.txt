What's the UPDATING code? Can I replace it with something more efficient?

It looks like I can interact with the worksheet by rewriting sagenb.async_request in sagenb.js.

Rewrite sagenb.worksheetapp.cell.check_for_output?

############# Dependencies #############

Python dependencies: pexpect, webassets, jinja2

############# Bugs and issues in sagenb #############

Sage bugs:
    sagenb.notebook.worksheet.check_comp(self, wait=.02) ignores the wait parameter.
    worksheet depends on notebook?
    sagenb.notebook.notebook.new_worksheet_process() does not set python='sage -python' when returning a new WorksheetProcess_ExpectImplementation object.
    sagenb.misc.misc tries to import from itself on line 177.
    sagenb.notebook.notebook.create_new_worksheet does not set _notebook on the new worksheet.

Sage "issues":
	The notebook server only assumes there will ever be one notebook instance.
	The notebook server fetches the source code from the local sage installation rather than the sage installation running the worksheet sage process.


############# Architecture #############

Guru/worksheet_webview
    conduit between WebView and worksheet.py.

Guru/worksheet_controller
    assigns filenames, opens/saves worksheets, assigns Sage instances, etc.
    
Guru/sage_process_controller
    Connects worksheets to remote and local Sage instances.
    Holds information about available Sage instances.

Changes required to worksheet.html
	Remove navbar.
	Initialization code expects a filename for the worksheet. Give it a meaningful filename instead of pulling from window.location.pathname.


############# Changes to sagenb #############

Changes made to:
	worksheet.py, cell.py: Fake interact import.
    
    notebook.py: In new_worksheet_process, when we return the worksheet process, we set python='sage -python'.

    sagenb/data/sage/html/*.html: removed leading /'s.

    base.html: Fixed reference to username.js to instead set sagenb.username directly.
    		   Removed navbar.

    sagenb.js: Rewrote sagenb.async_request to communicate with Python-javascript bridge instead of ajax.

    sagenb/data/webassets_generated/worksheet.js: Told where to find mathjax. (Do we need to do this with other javascript libraries?)

	worksheet.html: Commented out jmol stuff.

	load_mathjax.js: Told where to find mathjax. (Do we need to do this with other javascript libraries?)

	Mathjax.js: For some reason I had to keep Mathjax from accessing cookies. ??

	main.less: lesscss.js isn't @import'ing other .less files, so I put everything in one file.
